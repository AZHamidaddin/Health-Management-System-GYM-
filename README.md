# Health-Management-System-GYM-
This repository contains the classes and methods required to create the management system of a gym.


HMS is a gymnasium management system that helps any gym admin or help desk staff to
manage the gym membersâ€™ accounts by 1) registering members who can be singles or
families, 2) applying special discounts to some members, 3) registering members in physical
activity classes and services, 4) printing invoices and related search results. The HMS has
two types of members: single and family. The member class is a super-class abstract that has
the common attributes and methods in all types of members (see the figure below). The two
sub-classes SingleMember and FamilyMember each extends the super-class and define other
more specific attributes and methods. The gym system also offers many services (abstract
class) that can be divided into two subclasses classes (e.g., cardio, and cycling) and amenity
(e.g., swimming-pool, and steam-room).

After adding the members and services to the system. The help desk staff would be able to
register any member in any services. The help desk staff are also able to apply a special
discount on some memberships if the member is registered for 10 years or more. The gym
also offers the VIP costumers additional discount in some of classes only.
